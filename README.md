# MonoMakeFiles

Some example makefiles for using mono with make

Useful for providing basic makefiles when starting a new project

These are very very simple makefiles. We can always improve on them (PRs accepted!) they are however still useful when wanting to make say just a quick and dirty console app etc. They also show the basics of using make with mono

- library_makefile is a simple makefile for a single library with source in same folder
- console_makefile is a simple makefile for a single console app with source in same folder

Feel free to add your own.
